# Installable Text Editor 

## Description

Welcome to your new favorite text editor. It is simple, lightweight, and uses webpack to bundle all the front end files. Using several different Webpack plugins that provide service worker and caching capabilities, this text editor is able to be installed on your computer and used as a desktop application. The text editor also resebmles the look and feel of a javascript IDE, thanks to [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/). 

With this text editor, you can pseudocode to your heart's content, and then save your work to your computer. It can also function as a notes app if that's what you prefer! 

## Up and Running

To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Then run `npm run build` to build the project. Finally, run `npm run start` to start the server. The text editor will be available at `localhost:3000`.

The application is also available via Render. You can access it [here](https://installable-text-editor-with-webpack.onrender.com/). 

## Usage

The text editor is extremely intuitive. Simply type in the editor, and your changes will be automatically saved via the service worker. 

To install the text editor, click on the install button in the top left corner of the browser. The text editor will then be available as a desktop application.
